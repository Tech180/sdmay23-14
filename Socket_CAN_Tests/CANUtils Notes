Most basic example
Have 2 terminals open!

#In the first terminal type
sudo modprobe vcan
sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
sudo ip link set up vcan0
#This opens up vcan0 for communication


#In the second terminal type
candump vcan0
#this dumps can messages to the terminal that are sent to vcan0 in real time
#You may also run "candump vcan0 -l" to generate a log file

#Lastly in the first terminal type
cangen vcan0
#CAN messages are now being generated through vcan0
